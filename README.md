# Retro gaming :: a modern version of a "bubble bobble"-like written in Go with Ebiten

![Build](https://github.com/creativeprojects/cavern/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

The graphics and audio are borrowed from the excellent "code the classics" book, but the game is slightly different.

Works on macOS X, Windows, Linux, and inside a browser (in Web Assembly)
